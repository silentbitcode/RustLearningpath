# ü¶Ä Rust Job Readiness Track: From Zero to Hired

## üöÄ Overview and Goal Setting

Welcome to my personal **Rust Learning and Development Repository**!

This repository documents my deliberate path to mastering the Rust programming language, focusing specifically on the skills, projects, and domain knowledge required to land a professional role as a **Junior Rust Developer** or in a systems engineering capacity.

I will also be documenting and sharing periodic insights on X (formerly Twitter) here: [@SilentBitcode](https://x.com/SilentBitcode).

## üìÖ Learning Log: Fundamentals and Setup

This section tracks the initial steps, setup, and core concepts covered.

### Day 1 - Day 3: Initial Setup & Basic Syntax

| Status | Activity | Key Concepts/Tools | Code Artifacts |
| :---: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| ‚úÖ | **Environment Setup** | Installed **VSCodium** and necessary Rust extensions. | N/A |
| ‚úÖ | **Rust Playground Practice** | Practiced basic syntax and structure. | [Rust Playground Link](https://play.rust-lang.org/) |
| ‚úÖ | **Variables & Data Types** | **Mutability**, **Shadowing**, **Scope**, Primitive (Integers, Floats, Bools) and Compound Types (Tuples, Arrays). | N/A (Notes) |
| ‚úÖ | **Control Flow & Logic** | **Conditionals** (`if/else`), **Operators**. | N/A (Notes) |
| üõ†Ô∏è | **Project Start: Guessing Game** | Started building a number guessing game, focusing on understanding external libraries (`rand`) and **Error Messages**. | (Add link to your project code here) |
| ‚úÖ | **Functions & Directives** | Defined basic functions, explored **Compiler directives**. | N/A (Notes) |

## ‚è≠Ô∏è Next Steps

The focus for the next few days will be:
1.  Complete the **Number Guessing Game** project.
2.  Dive deep into the **Ownership, Borrowing, and Lifetimes** concepts.
3.  Start documenting a dedicated section for complex concepts.
