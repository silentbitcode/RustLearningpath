Welcome to my personal **Rust Learning and Development Repository**!

This repository documents my deliberate path to mastering the Rust programming language, focusing specifically on the skills, projects, and domain knowledge required to land a professional role as a **Junior Rust Developer** or in a systems engineering capacity.

I will also be documenting and sharing periodic insights on X (here: [@SilentBitcode](https://x.com/SilentBitcode).
