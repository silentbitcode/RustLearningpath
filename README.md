# RustLearningpath

Welcome to my personal Rust Learning and Development Repository!

This repository documents my deliberate path to mastering the Rust programming language, focusing specifically on the skills, projects, and domain knowledge required to land a professional role as a Junior Rust Developer or in a systems engineering capacity.

Will be documenting and sharing insights on [X](https://x.com/SilentBitcode) too.
